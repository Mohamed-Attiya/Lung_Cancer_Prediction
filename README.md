# Lung_Cancer_Prediction
This project focuses on predicting lung cancer using various machine learning algorithms. The primary goal is to develop a reliable model that can classify and predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on provided features. Early detection of lung cancer is crucial, and this project leverages machine learning techniques to assist in that process.
